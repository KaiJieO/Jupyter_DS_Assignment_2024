# Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success

This repository contains a Data Science project (2024) focused on analyzing and predicting student dropout rates and academic success. The project uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) to explore patterns, extract insights, and build predictive models.

## Key Highlights:

Data Exploration & Cleaning: Understand the dataset, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Transform and select features that impact student performance and retention.

Predictive Modeling: Implement machine learning models to predict dropout risks and academic success.

Evaluation & Insights: Assess model performance and derive actionable insights for educational interventions.

This project demonstrates practical application of Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and visualization tools in the context of educational data analysis.
